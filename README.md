# NumPy Masterclass — My Learning Journey & Concept Reinforcement

Welcome to my **NumPy Masterclass** repository! 

This repo is a curated collection of **concepts, code snippets, and projects** that I've worked through to **solidify my understanding** of NumPy and its real-world applications. It's not just a study log—it's also a **public showcase** of what I’ve learned and how I apply it.

Whether you're here to learn from my process or to assess my Python/NumPy proficiency, I hope this serves as a useful and transparent guide into how I approach technical learning.

##  What You'll Learn

###  NumPy Core Concepts

| Concept                    | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Array Creation            | Using `np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.arange`, `np.linspace`, etc.  |
| Array Properties          | Shape, size, dtype, ndim                                                    |
| Indexing and Slicing      | Accessing and modifying arrays using slicing and advanced indexing         |
| Array Operations          | Element-wise arithmetic, broadcasting, math functions                      |
| Reshaping Arrays          | `reshape()`, `ravel()`, `flatten()`, and transpose                         |
| Aggregations              | `sum()`, `mean()`, `max()`, `min()` with `axis` support                    |
| Boolean Masking           | Filtering using conditions and logical operations                          |
| Broadcasting              | Operating on arrays with different shapes efficiently                      |
| Linear Algebra            | Matrix multiplication, inverse, determinant, eigenvalues                   |
| Random Number Generation  | `np.random` for simulations and probabilistic modeling                     |
| Performance Tips          | Vectorization vs loops, memory efficiency, best practices                  |

## Proof-of-Concept Projects (PoC)

As a way to put my learning into action, I’ve developed three hands-on projects using only NumPy:

### 1️⃣ Linear Algebra with NumPy
`11_poc_linear_algebra/`

- Solve linear systems (`Ax = b`)
- Compute inverse and determinant
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Real-world use: Image transformation, equations solver

### 2️⃣ Sudoku Validator & Solver
`12_poc_sudoku/`

- Validate Sudoku grids using array slicing and masking
- Check rules for rows, columns, and 3×3 subgrids
- Optional backtracking-based solver (NumPy-optimized)

### 3️⃣ Monte Carlo Simulation
`13_poc_monte_carlo/`

- Estimate π using random sampling
- Simulate stock price paths with probabilistic models
- Demonstrate large-scale vectorized computations
